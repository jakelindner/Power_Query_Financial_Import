# PA_Financial_Import
## Project Goal
This project aims to show a business use case of Power Automate. By leveraging Power Automate, you can streamline the process of consolidating and transforming your employees' monthly account and balance files into a single Excel file. This consolidated file can be linked to a pivot table, providing an up-to-date data view.  

## Folder Structure
1. The PA_Financial_Import Project Folder is the main folder for the project.
2. The PA_Import_Folder is where the raw data is stored (PA=Power Automate).
3. The Power_Automate_Financial_Information Excel file is where you will utilize Power Automate to import the raw data.
4. The Random_Account_Generator is the Excel file that, when refreshed, can create multiple files for testing.
